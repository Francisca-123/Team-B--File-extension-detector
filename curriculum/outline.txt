getting the user file

Eg userFile = name.js

Get the extension

so that the name of the file will be split into two items in an array['name','js']

To get ext from the array use pop()

the last item is always the file extension

ie 'js'

write a function that prints out the name of file name after the the user inputs the file name and extension
